    <p>Challenges I faced included the following;</p>
    <p>1. Complex Cash Machine Troubleshooting: Facing complex issues while troubleshooting cash machines, such as hardware malfunctions or software errors, which required in-depth technical knowledge.</p>
    
    <p>2. Database Performance Bottlenecks: Identifying performance bottlenecks in the database system and optimizing queries for improved efficiency.</p>
    
    <p>3. Client-specific Requirements: Dealing with varying client-specific requirements is hard most especially for the token number machine, necessitating flexibility and customization in the development process.</p>
    
    <p>4. Managing Multiple Projects: Balancing multiple projects and tasks simultaneously, which could have created challenges in time management and prioritization.</p>
    
    <p>5. Hardware Compatibility Issues: Ensuring hardware compatibility while designing the prototype for the new cash machine model, particularly with different components and sensors.</p>
    
    <p>6. Sales Presentation Preparation: Preparing for the sales team presentation and addressing potential questions or concerns from the clients.</p>
    
    <p>7. Database Migration Challenges: Addressing potential issues during the database migration process from an older version to a newer version of SQL Server.</p>
    
    <p>8. User Training and Adoption: Ensuring successful user training and adoption of the new cash machine or token number machine systems at client locations.</p>

    <p>9. Transport fares: Uneasy easy transport when heading to the intern offices that is to it costed a lot of transport to travel to the internship office.</p>

    <p>10. Error fixing difficultiies: Challenges in fixing errors in systems for example a token machine at a Centenary bank had challenges with there database that is to say conflicting primary and foreign key which made the machine slow, inefficient and mulfunctioning.</p>
    
    <p>Solutions:</p>
    
    <p>1. Continuous Learning and Knowledge Sharing: Regularly updating technical knowledge through self-learning and seeking guidance from experienced team members to address complex troubleshooting challenges.</p>
    
    <p>2. Thorough Data Validation and Cleansing: Implementing rigorous data validation and cleansing procedures to ensure data accuracy in the database project and maintain data integrity.</p>
    
    <p>3. Database Indexing and Query Optimization: Applying indexing techniques and optimizing database queries to improve performance and address performance bottlenecks.</p>
    
    <p>4. Flexible Development Approach: Adopting an agile development approach to accommodate client-specific requirements and gather feedback throughout the development process.</p>
    
    <p>5. Effective Time Management: Using time management techniques, such as setting priorities and breaking down tasks, to manage multiple projects effectively.</p>
    
    <p>6. Hardware Compatibility Testing: Conducting thorough testing and simulations to ensure hardware compatibility and functionality for the new cash machine prototype.</p>
    
    <p>7. Data Encryption and Access Controls: Implementing robust data encryption and access control measures to protect sensitive information and comply with data privacy regulations.</p>
    
    <p>8. Thorough Presentation Preparation: Preparing comprehensive sales presentations with clear communication and addressing potential client concerns in advance.</p>
    
    <p>9. Database Migration Planning: Thoroughly planning the database migration process, conducting extensive testing, and having backup measures in place to mitigate potential issues.</p>
    
    <p>10. Comprehensive User Training: Providing comprehensive user training, documentation, and ongoing support to ensure successful adoption of new systems by clients and users.</p>
