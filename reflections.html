                <p>Based on the experiences and activities I have done during the course of my internship, here are some reflections that I have had:</p>

                <p>1. Reflection on Learning SQL:</p>
                <p>During my internship, I had the opportunity to learn and implement SQL, which was a pivotal skill for managing the databases of token machines and cash deposit machines. The hands-on experience in writing SQL queries and optimizing them provided valuable insights into efficient data handling. It was fulfilling to witness how my SQL knowledge directly contributed to improving the performance and reliability of the machines, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
                
                <p>2. Reflection on Machine Servicing:</p>
                <p>Servicing and maintaining cash deposit machines at various companies, including Lukka Plastics and City Tyres, taught me the importance of attention to detail and precision. Being responsible for the internal components of the machines helped me understand their intricate mechanisms better. I encountered and resolved different hardware issues, which honed my problem-solving skills and increased my confidence in handling such tasks independently.</p>
                
                <p>3. Reflection on Token Machine Issue Resolution:</p>
                <p>The challenges the team faced while fixing conflicting primary and foreign keys in the token machine system at Centenary Bank provided valuable learning opportunities. Identifying and resolving these issues required both technical knowledge and collaboration with the development team. Overcoming these obstacles taught me the significance of effective communication and teamwork in addressing complex problems.</p>
                
                <p>4. Reflection on On-Site Support:</p>
                <p>Providing on-site support to clients, especially at Centenary Bank, exposed me to real-world scenarios where quick troubleshooting was essential. This experience improved my ability to think on my feet and handle urgent situations calmly. Additionally, interacting directly with clients allowed me to develop strong communication skills and build professional relationships.</p>
                
                <p>5. Reflection on Continuous Learning:</p>
                <p>Throughout my internship, I embraced a mindset of continuous learning. Actively participating in training sessions and seeking opportunities to enhance my skills broadened my knowledge in database management, cash deposit machines and token machine technology. This commitment to learning not only benefited my internship but also prepared me for a successful career in the field of Information Technology.</p>
                
                <p>6. Reflection on Professional Growth:</p>
                <p>My time at Simba Technology provided a platform for significant professional growth. Taking on various roles and responsibilities taught me the importance of adaptability and versatility in the workplace. I gained confidence in my abilities and felt a sense of accomplishment as my contributions positively impacted the company and its clients. This internship has been a valuable stepping stone towards achieving my career goals.</p>
